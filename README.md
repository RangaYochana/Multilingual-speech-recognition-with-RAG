# 🗣️ Multilingual Speech Recognition with RAG

This project demonstrates **Multilingual Speech Recognition** enhanced with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It converts speech from multiple languages to text using **OpenAI Whisper** and uses contextual retrieval to generate more meaningful and accurate responses.



## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Converts speech from multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Telugu) into text
- 🌐 Translates and processes the text using a language model
- 📚 Uses RAG to enhance results by retrieving relevant context from a document database
- 💬 Outputs improved answers or summaries with the help of retrieved knowledge


## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **OpenAI Whisper** – For converting speech to text
- **LangChain** – For building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- **ChromaDB** – Used as a vector store for document retrieval
- **SentenceTransformers** – For embedding text into vectors
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – For advanced language modeling
